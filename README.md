Our project for The Hackathon: MetaFest.
World Improvement: Improve the life and ecosystems around us.

We are deeply concerned about the problem of environmental pollution.
We've cleaned up the seashore of the Adriatic sea in the area we are living. 
We hope that in the future people will have more responsible attitude for the environmental issues.
This is our little contribution to the World Improvement.
